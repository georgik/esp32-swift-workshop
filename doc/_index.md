Welcome to the ESP32-C6 Swift Embedded Workshop!

## About this workshop

This workshop introduces you to **Swift Embedded Development** on ESP32-C6 microcontrollers, demonstrating how to build production-ready IoT applications using Swift alongside traditional C development. You'll learn to create a complete MQTT-based IoT ecosystem with both C-based MQTT gateway infrastructure and Swift-based smart device clients.

Through hands-on assignments, you will master the integration of Swift 6.2's Embedded mode with ESP-IDF, explore advanced IoT communication patterns, and build a fully functional smart lighting system with MQTT device-to-device communication.

This workshop showcases the cutting-edge combination of Swift's modern language features with embedded systems programming, opening new possibilities for IoT development.

> This workshop uses ESP32-C6 exclusively due to its RISC-V architecture required for Swift Embedded support. The techniques learned here represent the future of embedded development with Swift.
